## Usage

### 1. Add Your Email and ID Password Provided by Gmail:

You can add this information in the `user.py` file inside the `user_requirements` function. In this part, if `requirement == 'User'`, change this `return_request = 'your_email@gmail.com'` and do the same with your password ID. **This password is NOT the password of your email.**

### 2. Possible Future Issues

Something you may encounter is that the email sender could break if, and only if, the email is not real. For example, if you have an email like `luis@gnail.com`. Note that "gnail" may not exist. Be careful when writing emails and ensure they are real and spelled correctly.
